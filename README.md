# Tic-Tac-Toe Weekend
---

## Objective

Build a Tic-Tac-Toe game incorporating the web technologies and techniques you've worked with thus far:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- DOM Manipulation

## Minimum Requirements
- Display an empty tic-tac-toe board when the page is initially displayed.
- A player can click on the nine cells to make a move.
- Every click will alternate between marking an `X` and `O`.
- Once occupied with an `X` or `O`, the cell cannot be played again.
- Provide a `Reset Game` button that will clear the contents of the board.
